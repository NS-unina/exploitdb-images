# Exploit DB

ExploitDB-images is a project that aims to detect the presence of new exploits in the repository and run them, automatically detecting the script language and creating a docker image to run on a generated container.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

* Git ([How to install Git on your machine](https://git-scm.com/downloads) )
* Docker: ([How to install Docker on your machine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) )
* Go Lang: ([How to install Go on your machine](https://go.dev/doc/install))
* PyCRE: ([How to execute PyCRE environment on your machine] (https://github.com/nju-websoft/PyCRE))

### Installing

* Clone the github repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/NS-unina/exploitdb-images.git
```

## Running the tests

* First, make sure docker is running on your local machine, or start it from desktop app or cli:

```
sudo service docker start
```

* Now you can run the test (make sure you are running it from the cloned folder):

```
cd exploit-dbimages
go run .
```

## Running statistics

* Change directory in statistics folder
```
cd statistics
```

* First, download exploits folder locally, from official github repo. You can perform this step by running this script
```
python download_exp.py
```

* For running statistics on snippets language run this script: output will be saved in [statistics.txt](statistics/statistics.txt), [py_snippets.txt](statistics/py_snippets.txt), [global_statistics.png](statistics/global_statistics.png), [wp_statistics.png](statistics/wp_statistics.png)
```
python download_exp.py
```

* For statistics on python version of python snippets run this script and make sure you've first runned previous steps: output will be saved in [version.txt](statistics/version.txt), [py2.txt](statistics/py2.txt), [py3.txt](statistics/py3.txt), [alternative_py.txt](statistics/alternative_py.txt), [no_version.txt](statistics/no_version.txt)
```
python check_version.py
```

* For dependency solving and automated import using PyCRE tool, run this script and make sure you've first runned previous steps: output will be saved in exploits folder and the related statistics are available in [parsed_percentage_results.txt](statistics/parsed_percentage_results.txt)
```
python run.py
```
