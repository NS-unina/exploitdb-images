# Exploit DB

ExploitDB-images is a project that aims to detect the presence of new exploits in the repository and run them, automatically detecting the script language and creating a docker image to run on a generated container.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

* Git ([How to install Git on your machine](https://git-scm.com/downloads) )
* Docker: ([How to install Docker on your machine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) )
* Go Lang: ([How to install Go on your machine](https://go.dev/doc/install))

### Installing

* Clone the github repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/NS-unina/exploitdb-images.git
```

## Running the tests

* First, make sure docker is running on your local machine, or start it from desktop app or cli:

```
sudo service docker start
```

* Now you can run the test (make sure you are running it from the cloned folder):

```
cd exploit-dbimages
go run .
```
