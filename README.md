# Exploit DB

ExploitDB-images is a project that aims to detect the presence of new exploits in the repository and run them, automatically detecting the script language and creating a docker image to run on a generated container.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

* Git ([How to install Git on your machine](https://git-scm.com/downloads) )
* Docker: ([How to install Docker on your machine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) )
* Go Lang: ([How to install Go on your machine](https://go.dev/doc/install))
* PyCRE: ([How to execute PyCRE environment on your machine] (https://github.com/nju-websoft/PyCRE))

### Installing

* Clone the github repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/NS-unina/exploitdb-images.git
```

## Running the tests

* First, make sure docker is running on your local machine, or start it from desktop app or cli:

```
sudo service docker start
```

* Now you can run the test (make sure you are running it from the cloned folder):

```
cd exploit-dbimages
go run .
```

## Running statistics

* Change directory in statistics folder
```
cd statistics
```
* In order to run correctly statistics script, please install requirements
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

* First, download exploits-db repository folder locally, from official github repo. You can perform this step by running this script
```
python download_exp.py
```

* Then, you can edit original exploit-db csv with language information. Output will be saved in [files_exploit_lang.csv](statistics/files_exploit_lang.csv)
```
python edit_csv.py
```

* For running statistics on snippets language run this script.
```
python pandas_statistics.py
```
Output will be displayed and you can check [files_exploit_lang.csv](statistics/files_exploit_lang.csv) for more informations.

* For statistics on python version of python snippets run this script and make sure you've first runned previous steps: output will be saved in [files_exploit_lang.csv](statistics/files_exploit_lang.csv), where you can find the version for each script. Percentage will be displayed.
```
python check_version.py
```

* For dependency solving and automated import using PyCRE tool, run this script and make sure you've first runned previous steps: output will be saved in exploits folder and the related statistics are available in [files_exploit_lang.csv](statistics/files_exploit_lang.csv) and percentage of correctly parsed snippets will be displayed.
```
python test_pycre.py
```
